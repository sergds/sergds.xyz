### About the game

**THE GAME IS NOT LOCALIZED FOR ENGLISH!**

The is an another notebook collection simulator, where you must avoid an angry russian teacher.

You are a student, who was playing games all school year instead of preparing for exams. Now you have sneaked into your school at late evening, walked past an empty-headed guard and have to search every room for hidden teacher's notebooks, without being caught.

Made in cooperation with FenzeEgi.

Some bugs:
- Stamina depletes too fast with normal FPS. (Something i couldn't test on my old laptop with ~50FPS)
- Teacher cannot approach you if you stand on a desk.
