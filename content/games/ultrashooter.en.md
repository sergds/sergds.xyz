### "Super game for IT Classes!"

**IN-GAME TEXT IS ONLY IN RUSSIAN!**

Help Stalin to protect world's superpower from evil germans!

Wish you successful defense of the fatherland, comrade!

The game is a classic arcade shooter, where player shoots bullets from bottom to top, to kill enemies and gain points.

The main difference of this shooter is that the enemy here is Hitler, and player is a Stalin, who shoots hammer and sickle to protect fatherland and gain points.

The game was initially created as a better clone of the same game i found on a school laptop. That game was written using Python/PyGame and was lagging when the player was shooting.

A 'normal' main menu was finished only in september 2022, the rest of ideas never saw a light of day. The game was abandonded in december 2022, the code is in terrible state and builds only on windows.

Controls:
- WASD — Movement
- Spacebar — Fire
